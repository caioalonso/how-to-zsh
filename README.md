# how-to-zsh

This is going to be a guide on how to get started with [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsh).

### Rationale
There are projects available such as [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), and [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), which are highly convenient and already offer a myriad of plugins and knobs to facilitate setting up zsh after you have experience. This project is not meant to be a replacement for those, but rather, something that will aid new zsh users in understanding the basics, so that they can know to choose whether they will want to roll out their own config or whether they're going to use a framework.
